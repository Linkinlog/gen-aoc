## Features

Generates a shiny new project folder for your chosen day of AOC madness

Automates boilerplate code and tests in your language of choice


## Usage (it's so easy, even a reindeer could do it)

```bash
./gen-aoc --day <day_number> --lang <lang>
```
```bash
--day: The AOC puzzle you're about to tackle
```
```bash
--lang: Currently only supports go & rust
```
```bash
--fresh: If you want a sparkling clean start, this flag wipes out any existing code
```

## Disclaimer

AOC Bootstrap won't magically solve the puzzles for you (darn!). But it'll give you a head start and maybe a chuckle or two.

Built with laziness and a sprinkle of procrastination

We know you'd rather be coding than setting up projects. Happy Advent of Code! üéÅ
